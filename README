This Matlab code includes 
1- The implementation of two Optimization based algorithms for solving influence maximization technique in social network for the purpose of advertising. These two algorithms are named Optimized Influence Maximization (OIM) and Hierarchcal Influence Maximization (HIM) and are described in detail in following published papers, respectively:

	- Mahsa Maghami, Gita Sukthankar, "Hierarchical Influence Maximization for Advertising in Multi-agent Markets," Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), pp. 21-27, Niagara Falls, Canada, August 25-28, 2013
	- Mahsa Maghami, Gita Sukthankar, "Identifying Influential Agents for Advertising in Multi-agent Markets," Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent System (AAMAS), Volume 2, pp. 687-694, Valencia, Spain, June 4-8, 2012.

2- The simulation of a multi-agent market where buyers (Regular Agents) and available products in the market (Product Agents) are presented as an individual agent with a desire vector. Buyers are connected with each other based on a social network that captured their interactions and products are correlated with each other based on the history of demand of of buyers. 


3- A synthetic network generator which creates a directed network for the buyers based on two homophily and link density parameters. This code is implemented by another colleage, Xi Wang, and the code is available also at :
